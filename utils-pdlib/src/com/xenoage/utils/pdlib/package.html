<p>
Xenoage pdlib (persistent data structures library) provides
persistent data structures based on the Java Collections API.
<p>
Rather than implementing these complicated techniques itself,
this library provides just a wrapper and works with an existing library.
Currently, <a href="http://code.google.com/p/pcollections/">pcollections</a>
are used (see license.txt).
<p>
The advantage for the developer when using this library is that always
the best implementation is used in the background. When a better library is available,
pdlib can integrate it, and the developer does not need
to change his own code but only update his copy of pdlib.
